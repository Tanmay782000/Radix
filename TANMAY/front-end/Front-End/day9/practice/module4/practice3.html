     <p>This will fill three paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum characters in the document but if you also control the amount of text that is generated through the above function as shown below:
        \=lorem(Number of Paragraphs, Number of Lines)
        For instance, =lorem(2,5) will create 2 paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum text and it will span across 5 lines (or sentences). The parameters are optional. If you omit the parameters the default number of paragraphs is three, and the default number of lines per paragraph is also three.The lorem() function is available in Word 2007 but if you are using a previous version of Office, you may use the good old rand() function to insert any amount of random text in your Word Document.
        If the lorem() generator is not working on your copy of Word, you probably have turned off the “Replace text as you type” option available under AutoCorrect.</p>
