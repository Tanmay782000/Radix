1. create a two interface called employee and salary

2. store both interface into (type bothinterface) eg. type bothinterface = employee & salary (intersection concept).

3. create an enum called gender3 & store male & female , call the declaration into array
 eg. gender : gender3.male or gender3.female

4. create 5 date functions and store it into different variables

5. Add items into botharrays[] and store it into res variable

6. Make new array using map (iterated over the array which is store in res),And also add the new field called employeecode(joiningyear + firstname + lastname[0])

7. sort the array by first name and year using sort method

8. filter the recored of currunt month joining(using filter method).

9. Create a new array using map function & store it into updatedarray variable
   declared var mr = "mr"
   declared var ms = "ms"
   into map(user => {   }) function I created If condition 
   where  
   if(user.gender === 'male')
   {
     mr+ fullname: user.first_name.concat(user.last_name) 
   }
   if(user.gender === 'female')
   {
     ms+ fullname: user.first_name.concat(user.last_name) 
   }

 into above conditional stateaments I created new field called fullname and concate the firstname and lastname

 10. used foreach loop to get each items salary fields
 11. performed average salary of employees
